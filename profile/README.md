# Edlucid

Welcome to the Edlucid developer hub! We build tools to help educational content creators seamlessly publish their curriculum into various Learning Management Systems (LMS).

## LTI Link Product

Our primary product, **LTI Link**, acts as a bridge, simplifying how publishers integrate their educational applications and content into their customers' LMS platforms. Using the industry-standard LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) 1.3 Advantage specification, LTI Link handles the complexities of LMS integration, allowing you to focus on creating great educational experiences.

**Why use LTI Link?**

*   **Broad Compatibility:** Connect your platform once and deploy to any LMS that supports LTI 1.3. This includes popular systems like Canvas, Moodle, Sakai, Blackboard, D2L Brightspace, and many more.
*   **Simplified Distribution:** Streamline the process of getting your content in front of students within the environments they already use.
*   **Secure & Standardized:** Leverage the robust security features and interoperability benefits of the latest LTI standard.
